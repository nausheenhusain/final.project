		<h1> Data Viz Final Project Pitch: Chicago Public Schools "Safe Passage Routes" </h1><br>
	

	<h2> The Pitch </h2>

		CPS has deemed certain sections of streets "safe passage routes" for kids in the city of Chicago who have to walk to school. Many publications have reported that the safe passage routes aren't actually all that safe. I'd like to map where exactly <a href="http://www.cps.edu/Pages/safepassage.aspx" "target=blank"> the safe passage routes are</a>  with <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2" "target=blank"> how much crime there has actually been</a> on those blocks. <br> The map would be interactive so that a reader can click on a CPS school and see crime that has taken place within a few blocks of that school.

	<h2> News Angle </h2>

		CPS decided to close almost 50 CPS schools over the summer because of budgetary reasons. Critics of that decision have complained that students will now have to walk to their new schools through dangerous areas of Chicago, particularly in the South Side. CPS has designated areas around CPS schools "safe passage routes" and are working to reduce crime in those particular areas.

	<h2> Sources </h2>

		Chicago Public Schools
		Chicago Police Department 

	<h2> Background </h2>

		The Sun-Times has been covering <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/22506584-418/safe-passage-routes-rife-with-sex-offenders.html" "target=blank"> crime on safe passage routes </a> since at least the beginning of the summer, and the New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/01/02/us/chicago-killings.html" "target=blank"> a map</a> that I think I might be able to use for my project.

		<h2> Publication </h2>

		I would like to pitch this to the Chicago Sun-Times.

		<h2> Preliminary Questions </h2>

			How much crime has happened along "safe passage routes" since it began in 2009?
CPS claims that there has been a 20 percent decrease in criminal incidents along safe passage schools - is this true? Has there been a long-term decline?
Have crime rates increased or decreased significantly since the closing of almost 50 CPS schools in June?

	<!-- 2. IslamForReporters: <br><br>

	Master's Project summary: Even before the events of September 11, 2001, American Muslims faced inaccurate, sometimes even discriminatory, coverage in American print and broadcast media. Though some coverage was ill-intentioned negligence, much of it was a genuine lack of resources on Islam-related issues for reporters, especially those on deadline. I want to create a resource for reporters, in the form of a website and smartphone app, through which they can get accurate data on Islamophobic incidents in the U.S. and context on American Islamic issues. <br>
I'd like to analyze <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime"> FBI hate crime data</a> from 1995 to 2011 to visualize for my Master's project.<br>
